# 🏋️ Fitness Tracker SQL Project

This project is a personal fitness tracker built in SQLite to practice SQL skills and apply them to real-world style data.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The database tracks:
- Users
- Workouts (date, type, duration)
- Exercises (sets, reps, weight)

I use SQL queries to analyze:
- Training volume
- Exercise progression
- Workout frequency
- Estimated 1 Rep Max (1RM)

## ⚡ Example Queries
- Total workout volume per session  
- Favorite exercise (most frequent)  
- 1 Rep Max progression over time  

## 🔧 Tech
- SQLite  
- SQL  

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Connect to Power BI for dashboards  
- Add nutrition and body measurements tracking
